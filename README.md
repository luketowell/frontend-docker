This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Docker build command
- The below command builds from the dockerfile.dev build file.
`docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .`

making use of the docker volumes in order to monitor the files in the current directory.
- ```docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/usr/app 9c1e84fdfe3f```
- This command maps the appropriate ports but then it maps the volumes for the app/node_modules and then also maps all of the files within the current working directory to the specific location in the container.

## docker-compose
- The docker-compose setup of the application contains two services: the web service and the test service. the test service is solely used for running tests whilst the web service is used for running and monitoring the application files. 
- 
- When the files are updated the application will be relaunched and tests will be re-ran.
- in order to build both applications:
- `docker-compose up --build`

- in order to run single services:
- `docker-compose up <service name>`




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
